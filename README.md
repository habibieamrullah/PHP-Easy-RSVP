How to use it?
- Make your own web favicon and place it in this directory. For example you can use this online favicon generator service in this link: https://www.favicon-generator.org/ , then generate your favicon, download the zip file from that website, and extract it in this directory to replace existing favicons.

- Create a MYSQL database in your server, for example "mydatabase".

- Open and edit config.php file, adjust all the settings as according your need, especially Mailing Settings.
